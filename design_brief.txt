I would like to use black text only; however, the background color will be Green, Orange, and Red, because these colors will make my website look more fresh and brighter. these colors will catch my readers' attention. I'll use black text for the Header, for body, and for link-text.

	1. I liked its logo; however, I disliked the front color, the red color doesn't seems really catch people's attention. The header of this page is from the top where it has logo and social media logos. the main is from the big red image down to the pink cartoon character with three eyes. Finally, the footer is from the word "© Copyright 2019 - Studio Schurk"
